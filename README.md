# Instagram_Bot
An instagram bot that likes every posts in an account , (created for fun)

The bot needs 3 things to function :
1. Python 3  https://www.python.org/
2. Selenium https://pypi.org/project/selenium/ or https://www.selenium.dev/
3. Install the browser driver (firefox in my code) https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases 

You will need an account on instagram to like other people's posts 

In the code you will need to enter :

1. Your account name / spam account name
2. Your account password / spam account password
3. The name of the account you want to like
4. The location of the driver (eg : X:\my_bot\geckodriver.exe)
